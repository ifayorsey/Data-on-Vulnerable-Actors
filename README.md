# StatesofExtraction


This past semester, I had the privilege of taking Manuela Picqâ€™s States of Extraction class at Amherst College. More than once, I was shocked to discover the extent of transgressions many Latin American governments carrying out on their own people, and additionally the lack of visibility and coverage surrounding these issues. When the opportunity came to carry out an intervention project, I was naturally excited to try and create a model that highlighted the plight of nature defenders. However I was quite alarmed at how little, and spread out data on the issue was. For my intervention project, I wanted to make information like this more accessible to statisticians and those alike who may not necessarily come in contact with such information, but can be useful agents in further bringing awareness to the issue.

The dataset I uploaded to Github contains 31 observations and 15 variables ranging from land area and oil production, to corruption and military indexes. 
Sources of data include:


* https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/
* https://epi.envirocenter.yale.edu
* https://www.globalfirepower.com
* https://tradingeconomics.com

Most of the challenges in creating this intervention surrounded the creation of the dataset. Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and the Phillipines account for 80% of the nature defenders killed. This made the variable difficult to predict given what little counts appeared in the other observations, and initially derailed the direction of my project. Adding more countries only severed to obscure this relationship by increasing the number of observations where defenders were not at risk. The next issue that came about was the consistency of some of the indexes. I frequently found myself crossing check some of these figures and often was unsure of which numbers where more accurate. Although these issues are present, they did not greatly impact the goal of increasing the visibility of this information. It is my hope that students interacting with this data leave with more insight into these issues, and with the knowledge that intervention and activism can take shape in many forms!
