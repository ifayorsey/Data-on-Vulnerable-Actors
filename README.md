# StatesofExtraction


This past semester, I had the privilege of taking Manuela Picqâ€™s States of Extraction class at Amherst College. More than once, I was shocked to discover the extent of transgressions many Latin American governments carrying out on their own people, and additionally the lack of visibility and coverage surrounding these issues. When the opportunity came to carry out an intervention project, I was naturally excited to try and create a model that highlighted the plight of nature defenders. However I was quite alarmed at how little, and spread out data on the issue was. For my intervention project, I wanted to make information like this more accessible to statisticians and those alike who may not necessarily come in contact with such information, but can be useful agents in further bringing awareness to the issue.

The dataset I created contains 31 observations and 15 variables ranging from land area and oil production, to corruption and military indexes. Sources of data include:


* https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/
* https://epi.envirocenter.yale.edu
* https://www.globalfirepower.com
* https://tradingeconomics.com
* https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resource-publication/annual-report-human-rights-defenders-risk-2017


Most of the challenges in creating this intervention surrounded the creation of the dataset. Foremost, the consistency of data was something I had to pay close attention to. Although my sources were reputable, there were some discrepancies in certain indexes and alleged poverty rates. The next biggest issue I had was the spread of nature defenders killed. As you can see from the preliminary analysis file, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and the Phillipines account for 80% of the nature defenders killed. This made the variable difficult to predict given what little counts appeared in the other observations.
